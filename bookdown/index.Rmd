**Note**: This thesis has been published by EPFL.
The source code for both LaTeX and bookdown documents are available in the [Github repository](https://github.com/damar-wicaksono/wd41-thesis).

The thesis was successfully defended in a closed oral exam session at the EPFL campus on January 19, 2018 in front of jury members and publicly thereafter at the Paul Scherrer Institut on February 23, 2018.
The jury members were:

- Prof. Romuald Houdré of EPF Lausanne (President of the jury)
- Prof. Andreas Pautz of EPF Lausanne (Director of the thesis)
- Mr. Omar Zerkak of PSI (Co-director of the thesis)
- Dr. Winfried Zwermann of [GRS](https://www.grs.de/)[^GRS] (Rapporteur)
- Dr. Jean Baccou of [IRSN](https://www.irsn.fr/EN/Pages/Home.aspx)[^IRSN] (Rapporteur)
- Prof. Bruno Sudret of ETH Zurich (Rapporteur)

## Document Releases {-}

There are four different versions of the thesis available:

1. The EPFL Infoscience hosts the final official version of the thesis in [PDF format](https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/253113?ln=en),
   which was also used in the print version.
   Unfortunately, during pre-processing for printing, the table of contents
   and the hyperlinks for the cross references were all broken.
2. [The Github project page](https://github.com/damar-wicaksono/wd41-thesis/blob/master/wd41_thesis.pdf)
   hosts the version in PDF with the broken links fixed.
   The version also adds nomenclature for alphanumeric and greek symbols
   as well as some fixes to several typos found later on.
3. [Read the Docs](http://wd41-thesis.readthedocs.io/en/feature-sphinx/)
   hosts the thesis generated using the sphinx documentation generator.
4. [Github pages](http://damar-wicaksono.github.io/wd41-thesis/index.html) also hosts the thesis generated using the Bookdown document generator.

## Presentation {-}

Two sets of slides related to the defense were presented in two difference occasions:
the [oral exam](https://speakerdeck.com/dcwicaksono/bayesian-uncertainty-quantification-of-physical-models-in-thermal-hydraulics-system-codes) (closed session)
and [public defense](https://speakerdeck.com/dcwicaksono/bayesian-uncertainty-quantification-of-physical-models-in-thermal-hydraulics-system-codes-1) (open session).
They are both hosted at [Speaker Deck](https://speakerdeck.com/dcwicaksono/).

## About this bookdown version {-}

This bookdown version is my attempt to make the thesis easily accessible on the web
for, first and foremost, myself.
I still refer to my thesis every now and then in my current work
and I thought it would be nice not to have to download the PDF version everytime.
I started a similar project using `sphinx-doc` but the project somehow stalled,
maybe I'll pick it up again someday.
This thesis remains the single longest document I've ever written so far.
When it was finished I was so relieved and rather impressed with myself.
The feeling didn't last that long, though.

# Acknowledgments {-}

This doctoral research has been conducted in the framework of the [STARS](https://www.psi.ch/de/stars) project
in the Laboratory for Reactor Physics and Systems Behavior (LRS)[^LRS]
at the Paul Scherrer Institut (PSI).
Besides providing me with a comfortable working place,
PSI through the STARS project also kindly financed all the trips
taken during the course of the doctoral research,
including NUTHOS-10 in Okinawa, NURETH-16 in Chicago, SAMO 2016 in Capri,
NUTHOS-11 in Gyeongju, as well as several trips to the OECD/NEA office in Paris.

It is my cultural reflex to readily admit that any successful work is a collective effort,
sometimes with God's blessing thrown into the mix;
while any eventual shortage is to be credited to me and me alone.
This is especially true for this work which at times---if not most of the times---felt really difficult to carry out.
So I am truly grateful for the support and contributions of so many people:
	
- Prof. Andreas Pautz, the thesis director, for giving me the opportunity
  to conduct this research and to extend, several times, my stay in Switzerland.
  I appreciate his support all these years and wish him all the best
  navigating the Nuclear Energy and Safety Division of PSI in an evermore turbulent times.

- Mr. Omar Zerkak and Dr. Gregory Perret who have invested in me
  so much of their time, knowledge, and patience that allowed me to start
  and finish the thesis.
  I am truly grateful for those, especially when the thesis was becoming
  harder and harder to finish.
	
- Mr. Philippe Jacquemoud, in his own word an IT "all-rounder",
  who has been truly helpful providing me with IT-related supports,
  but perhaps much more importantly, by being a very good friend.
  
- Dr. Jean Baccou, Prof. Bruno Sudret, and Dr. Winfried Zwermann
  for their willingness to sit on my PhD committee,
  evaluating the thesis over the Christmas holiday period and attending the defense.
  It has been my privilege to have them in my committee
  and I am truly grateful for their invaluable comments, feedback, and questions.
	
- Dr. Mathieu Hursin and Dr. Dimitri Rochman, who appeared
  to be genuinely interested in my work and gave invaluable comments
  during these period.
	
- Mr. Hakim Ferroukhi and Dr. Ivor Clifford who have always been appreciative
  and supportive towards my work in their units.
	
- Mrs. Ruth Ringele and Mrs. Andrea Mohr who have been truly kind and helpful
  dealing with the administrative matters during my PhD research.
  
- The present and past members of the LRS, especially the STARS Coffee Club members
  who have created for me a conducive---fun and mostly productive---working environment.
	
- Abhishek Saxena, Rita Szijártó, Yaroslav Sych, Olivier Leray,
  Gregory[^Greg] and Rebecca Lordan-Perret, Carl Adamsson, Younsuk Yun,
  Raoul Ngayam-Happy, Riccardo Puragliesi, Kinga Bernatowicz-Gomà,
  Dionysios and Vera Chionis, Petra Mala[^Petra], Vladimir Brankov,
  and Matthew and Deborah Stark-Studer; friends,
  some are newer than the others, but good friends all the same.
  It is easy to forget that I am thousands of kilometers away from home;
  during this period, these people have been--in one way or another--my "immediate family".
  
- Fauziah Satriana who provides me with a sense of being at home anywhere
  I am with her[^Fauziah].
  Her patience and understanding towards me during the thesis write-up period
  will remain a mystery I am not willing to rationalize.
  
- My family back home who all seem to be genuinely proud of what I have achieved[^Family].

[^LRS]: which by the time this thesis is printed ceases to exist. Perhaps it just metamorphosizes to a better form...
[^Greg]: Déjà vu? Actually yes, and triple the thanks!
[^Petra]: Things are not always easy, nor fair, but perhaps you could hold on for a little bit longer and get that piece of paper nobody seems to care about. Or so it seems...
[^Fauziah]: which unfortunately not that often, yet...
[^Family]: But I know better...
